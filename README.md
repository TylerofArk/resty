Referenced starter code and worked alongside Luis Rosales.

## Business Requirements

Our application will be an API testing tool that can be run in any browser, allowing a user to easily interact with APIs in a familiar interface.

## Phase 1 Requirements

Today, we begin the first of a 4-Phase build of the RESTy application, written in React. In this first phase, our goal is to setup the basic scaffolding of the application, with intent being to add more functionality to the system as we go. This initial build sets up the file structure so that we can progressively build this application in a scalable manner

## Lab 26

Refactor all of the child components of App.js from classes to functions. Use .scss pages to style the webpage.
